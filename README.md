# House Rent Data Visualization

This project presents a detailed Power BI dashboard built using a housing rental dataset. It provides insights into rental trends across Indian cities, helping users understand market dynamics based on factors like city, locality, size, furnishing status, and tenant preferences.

- `BHK`: Number of bedrooms  
- `Rent`: Monthly rent in INR

- `Tenant Preferred`: Type of tenant (Family, Bachelors, etc.)  
- `Bathroom`: Number of bathrooms  
- `Point of Contact`: How to contact the listing party
